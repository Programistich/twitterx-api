# Production override for docker-compose.yml
# This file replaces the build directive with a pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# The image is automatically built and pushed by GitHub Actions on every push to main branch

services:
  twitter-api:
    image: ghcr.io/programistich/twitter-api:latest
    build: null  # Disable local build
    pull_policy: always  # Always pull the latest image
